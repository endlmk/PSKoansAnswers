    Comparison Operators

    Comparison operators are often used to compare two values. If the values
    satisfy the condition set by the operator, the expression returns $true;
    otherwise, it returns $false.

    Mathematical comparison operators are two letters preceded by a hyphen:
    -eq, -ne, -gt, -lt, -le, -ge

    Logical comparison operators include:
    -and, -or, -xor, -not

            <#
                When applying comparison operators to arrays, note:
                    1. The array must always be on the LEFT hand side of the comparison,
                    2. The comparison FILTERS the array, and
                    3. The comparison will always return either:
                        - One or more items for which the comparison would evaluate to $true, OR
                        - Nothing whatsoever (neither $true, nor $false).

                A comparison framed like this will essentially always result in a $false result:
                    $value -eq $array
