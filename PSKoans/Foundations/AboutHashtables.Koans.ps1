    Hashtables

    Hashtables are a more advanced type of collection than arrays, and use string keys as a kind of
    'index' rather than index numbers. A simple PowerShell hashtable can be created with a hash
    literal, which looks like this:

    @{
        Key  = 'Value'
        Age  = 12
        Name = "Robert '); DROP TABLE 'STUDENTS'"
    }

    Hashtables are more difficult to iterate over than arrays, but have the advantage of being able
    to more easily access exactly the item you want from the collection. In the above example, it's
    quite simple to access only the Age or Name value, as you please.

    Hashtables are also frequently used as input to many more customisable parameters for
    PowerShell cmdlets.
